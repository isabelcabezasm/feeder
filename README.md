Let's build a feeder for my pets

You can check the project process here:

The Feeder module runs in a Raspbery Pi from the [main.js](iot/main.js) file. To run it we will use the [pm2](https://pm2.io) library, you can see how to install it from the [install-daemon.sh](iot/install-daemon.sh) script.


(Of course, I'll write a proper readme when I finish it)
